# PipPrototype
Messing around with NES assembly while following the NerdyNights Tutorials Archive. Pip is the name of my Hedgehog, so I am making him the main character of this little tidbit, but don't intend to make a full game, just intend to learn and make stuff to solidify what I have learned.

Also, I am using JNes to make the sprites, so the pipart file is the save from that.
